# Just enough Nextflow

Nextflow is very well documented and there is some great in-depth training material available.

See the official [Nextflow Training](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/), or [Introduction to Bioinformatics workflows with Nextflow and nf-core](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/workflows-nextflow/index.html) for a comprehensive introduction and deeper dive.

Here we will focus on downloading, configuring and running a Nextflow pipeline.
