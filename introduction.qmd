# Introduction

Post-Alphafold2, new deep learning methods in _de novo_ protein design have emerged with unprecedented success rates for folding and activity generated sequences.

This workshop aims to explore one key design goal - generating small proteins _in silico_ that bind to a target protein with high affinity and specificity.

We will use two leading methods - one based on RFdiffusion, one and using BindCraft.
