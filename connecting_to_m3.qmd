We will use [M3 "Strudel" Remote Desktops](https://m3-desktop.erc.monash.edu/) ([docs](https://docs.erc.monash.edu/M3/Strudel/RemoteDesktops)) today, so everyone gets their own GPU on a compute node. We will run everything on that compute node, rather than submitting additional jobs to the SLURM queue.

- Login at [https://m3-desktop.erc.monash.edu/](https://m3-desktop.erc.monash.edu/)
  - Choose "M3 with AAF login"
    - If you M3 account is associated with an institutional email address, use the orange AAF login button
    - If your M3 account is associated with a Google/gmail address, use the Google login button

- Select **VS Code Server** in the sidebar.
- Select **T4**, **4 hours**. 
- Edit the **"Advanced Options"** and add: `--reservation=oct27workshop` to the SBATCH command.
- Press **Launch**.
- Wait a few seconds, then press **"Connect"** under the "Pending/Running VS Code Servers" section.
  - Watch out for popup window blocking from the browser - allow the popup if it was blocked

Once you have the VS Code session running, click on the _'two bits of paper'_ icon in the sidebar, click Open Folder, and enter `/scratch2/pd27/`.

You can open a new Terminal with `` Ctrl+Shift+` `` (backtick), or find "Terminal -> New Terminal" in the hamburger menu.

Install these VS Code extensions (the _'four squares'_ icon in the sidebar, or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`):

- Protein Viewer ( `ArianJamasb.protein-viewer` ) - Molstar inside vscode
- "CSV" ( `ReprEng.csv` )
- Rainbow CSV ( `mechatroner.rainbow-csv` )
- Live Preview ( `ms-vscode.live-server` )

Now let's create your user directory where you'll work today. In the Terminal, run:

```bash
mkdir -p /scratch2/pd27/users/${USER}
cd /scratch2/pd27/users/${USER}
```
