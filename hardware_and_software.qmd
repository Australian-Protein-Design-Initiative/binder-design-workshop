# Hardware and software requirements

Or, _"how can I run this at home ?"_

## Compute resources

_What kind of hardware do I need ?_

> TODO: GPUs, the more the better. Local workstation example, HPC example, cloud example.

# Software 

## Licensing

The foundation of these tools are available under under permissive open source licenses and can be used freely for _non-commercial use_. However, **NOTE** that PyRosetta, a component of both RFDiffusion and BindCraft, requires a license from the University of Washington for commercial use.

## Installation

::: {.callout-warning}

**For this workshop, you don't need to install anything.** We've set things up to run in Apptainer containers that are already downloaded.

Installing these packges typically takes hours, and troubleshooting research software installation is a topic for an entirely different wokshop.

:::

You'll want a Linux based operating system. You do not nessecarily need admin / sudo permissions.

Methods, roughly in order of preference:

## 1. Engage your local HPC or research cloud admins to help create a shared installation everyone can use. 

They are often experienced in troubleshooting installation and dependency issues that can be specific to the systems they maintain.

## 2. Use a container

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (formerly known as Singularity) simplifies deployment of software by bundling up the software and its dependencies, including a simple Linux system image, into a single container.

Docker is another popular alternative, but isn't usually available on HPC systems due to security constraints.

Apptainer can run Docker images, so you rarely need Docker to run research software.

All the container images used in this workshop are available [here](https://github.com/orgs/Australian-Protein-Design-Initiative/packages?repo_name=containers) and the Dockerfile recipes used to build them are available [here](https://github.com/Australian-Protein-Design-Initiative/containers).

## 3. Use a pipeline

A Nextflow pipeline [like nf-binder-design](https://github.com/australian-protein-design-initiative/nf-binder-design) can help manage running all the steps in an RFdiffusion - ProteinMPNN - Alphafold2 (or BindCraft) workflow.

The best pipelines typically use publically available Apptainer containers by default, so you don't need to think about installing each of the tools yourself.

## 4. Install yourself

Follow the instrucions at https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion and https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft - the installation steps are well documented, but don't always work perfectly in every environment without some troubleshooting.

# At Monash

`nf-binder-design` has a configuration profile for the M3 HPC cluster.
